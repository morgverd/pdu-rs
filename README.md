# PDU-RS

This repository contains a subset of extracted code from:
- **Original Repository**: https://github.com/eeeeeta/huawei-modem
- **Original Author**: [eeeeeta](https://github.com/eeeeeta)
- **Original License**: Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal

## Why This Subset?

This subset contains only the GSM PDU encoding / decoding for both `SMS-SUBMIT` and `SMS-DELIVER`.
The original repository is a full modem implementation and therefore comes packaged with many more
dependencies which are unnecessary if you intend to only use it's PDU parser.

## Licensing

This code maintains the same license as the original work.
